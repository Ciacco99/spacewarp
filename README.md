# SpaceWarp - Generative Local Edits - Computational Photography
SpaceWarp is a program that will take an image as input and generate an aesthetically pleasing edit of the image as if it was captured in deep space. 


## Structure
At this time the structure of this branch is the following:

- data: input, output, examples and screenshots data (partially removed from repo due to size)
- notebooks: jupyter notebooks for testing and development
  - exploration_datasets.ipynb: notebook for exploring the initial input datasets
  - exploration_generation.ipynb: notebook for exploring the generation process to create the pair datasets original->edited which will then be used for training
  - exploration_training.ipynb: notebook for exploring the training process of the model given the pair dataset 
- src: source code
- README.md: this file
